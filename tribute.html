            Henry Ford (July 30, 1863 - April 7, 1947) was an American industrialist and business 
            magnate. He was the founder of Ford Motor Company, and chief developer of the assembly 
            line technique of mass production. Ford created the first automobile that middle-class 
            Americans could afford, and his conversion of the automobile from an expensive luxury into 
            an accessible conveyance profoundly impacted the landscape of the 20th century.
